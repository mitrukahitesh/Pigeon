# WhatsApp-Clone
Tried to implement some features of WhatsApp in this android chat app written with Java. Firebase is used for backend.
Features include:
- Phone number authentication
- Listing the users from phone's contact list that are registered with this app
- Realtime text messaging
- Showing "last seen" of any user
